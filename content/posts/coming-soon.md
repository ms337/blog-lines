I recently decided that I will write and publish posts on some of things I think about. 

I think I have interesting things to say on AI (in particular on LLMs), startups and what I call "practical philosophy" — conceptual analyses on various topics to help get what one wants. 


I will be sharing them here for your reading and feedback. Hello world!
