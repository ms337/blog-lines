Worked with a team on a web app to search for medicines, ventillators and other supplies for Covid related emergencies for India. 240K+ users have used the app.

Backend team lead. Solutioned features and requirements. Chief-bug-fixer.

Worked on this with [Apoorv](https://twitter.com/ApoorvSingal), [Swarnim](https://twitter.com/SwarnimVW) and [Anshul](https://twitter.com/anshulagx). These guys are young, but brilliant engineers who get the job done.
