title: Hotspot and Binding Residue Prediction Using Embeddings
category: research

---

Did my thesis on using protein sequence embeddings from transformers for hotspot and binding residuce prediction from primary protein sequences.

To the author's knowledge, this was the first time that transformer-based  embedings applied to the binding residue and hotspot prediction problems.
