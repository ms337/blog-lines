title: Data Modelling for a Theory of Variable Physical Constants
category: research
---

Requested by auther to perform basic data modelling to verify a theory of varying physical constants in the paper:

"Cosmology with relativistically varying physical constants" by Rajendra P. Gupta.

Published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, staa2472, https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa2472, 25 August 2020

Wrote verification code in Python. 
Setup and parameterized original simulation software (https://alterbbn.hepforge.org/) in C.
