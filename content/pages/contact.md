### Founders/Startups

I enjoy helping founders out on the weekends with technical input, strategy and questions of product market fit.

The best way I believe I help is to sanity check your thinking, help you devise strategy and push the scope of your idea.Â 

The most common mistake I think founders make is that they chase a version of their idea that sounds plausible and is close to what already exists, instead of permuting it to something which is singular and can be big. I act as a sounding board to your exploration of your idea's [idea maze](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1465018656979492871?lang=en), discuss why what you are building towards is an inevitable state in the world, and strategize its execution and realization with you.

I am also happy to provide specific technical input to founders, engineers and investors on LLM training, data infrastructure and build systems and products around LLMs.

I do this purely as an intellectual interest, so please don't use this as a hiring call :)
