### Founders/Startups

I also help a lot of founders out on the weekends with technical input, strategy and questions of product market fit.

The best way I believe I help is to sanity check your thinking, help you devise strategy and push the scope of your idea.Â The most common mistake I think founders make is that they chase a version of their idea that sounds plausible and close to what already exists, instead of permuting it to something which is singular and can be big. I act as a sounding board to explore your idea's [idea maze](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1465018656979492871?lang=en), discuss why your creation is an inevitable development, and strategize its execution and realization with you.

I am also happy to provide specific technical input on training LLMs, data infrastructure, building ML and AI services, and useful ideas from AI/ML research. 

I do this purely as an intellectual interest, so please don't use this as a hiring call :)

### Technical Consulting

I also help founders and engineers with specific, highly technical input on two topics: training LLMs and how to build AI products with LLMs. Best way is to tell me about (1) the problem you are solving and (2) you current solution state and we take it from there. 

I have also helped out good investors in the past by providing opinionated, technical input based on my vantage point and what I see is up and coming in research. I find valuable things out of interest and think about how they would create economic value and so I share these thoughts with folks to test them.
