### What to Contact Me For

Previously I loved talking to founders and hackers on the weekends regarding their startups/projects, strategy, product ideas or just general brainstorming if the idea/topic seemed interesting.

Unfortunately, I am too busy with my own company these days, so I have less time for that. But I am happy to help with more of the usual things like intros etc. if I can. 

The fastest way to get something from me is through email. Fair warning, I may go MIA for a day or two if something high priority has all my focus, which happens a lot when one is trying to get a company off the ground. 

I may not reply to all emails, but will try my best to.
