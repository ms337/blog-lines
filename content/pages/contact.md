### What to Contact Me For

I enjoy talking to founders and hackers on the weekends regarding their startups/projects, strategy, product ideas or just general brainstorming if the idea/topic seems interesting.

For founders, the best way I believe I help is by helping you sanity check your thinking, devise strategy and push the scope of your idea.Â The most common mistake I see my founder friends make is that they chase a version of their idea that sounds plausible and is close to what already exists, instead of permuting it to something which is singular and can be big.

I am also happy to provide specific technical input to founders, engineers and investors on LLM pretraining and post-training, data infrastructure and training data pipelines, and more generally building systems and products around LLMs.

I do this purely as an intellectual interest, so please don't use this as a hiring call :)
