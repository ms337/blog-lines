# Bookshelf

Inspired by [Patrick Collison's bookshelf](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf), these are books that I have read or are currently/soon on my shelf. These capture most of what I am interested in. 

I think that a good measure of "usefulness of a book" is how surprising do you find the ideas/facts the book contains. An interesting parallel is in information theory where the measure of the quantity of information content is called [surprisal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_content).
