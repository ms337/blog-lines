# Bookshelf

Inspired by [Patrick Collison's bookshelf](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf), these are books that I have read or are currently on/will soon be on my shelf. These books capture most of what I am interested in.

I think that a good measure of "usefulness of a book" is how surprising you find the ideas and facts the book contains. An interesting parallel is in information theory: the measure of the quantity of information content is called [surprisal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_content).
