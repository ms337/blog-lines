# Work

The following are some of the things I have worked on that I can publicly share: 

&nbsp;

### Open Source 
Trained and open sourced code completion LLMs at Replit.

#### Replit V1.5
- [Hugging Face Open Source Repo](https://huggingface.co/replit/replit-code-v1_5-3b)
- [Results Preview](https://x.com/amasad/status/1711513492635922822?s=20)
- [Blog Post](https://blog.replit.com/replit-code-v1_5)


#### Replit V1
- [Hugging Face Open Source Repo](https://huggingface.co/replit/replit-code-v1-3b)
- [Technical Blog](https://blog.replit.com/llm-training)
- Designed the training data infrastructure and pipelines, built feature engineering pipelines for increasing data quality, trained the tokenizer and vocabulary, did the actual model training and evaluation

#### Replit AI Chat
- Designed and implemented the new standalone backend service for Replit's AI Chat
- Designed, prototyped and implemented the first set of agent features

### Presentations/Talks

#### 2023

-  [A Hacker’s Guide to Building with LLMs: Hacking, training, customizing, and building with LLMs without requiring ridiculous resources](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTLjv-8VLKHhnD2yXx7jw9Zmf4qPbEdIbzeNUYUzPDZUerINe3j5PvRMVVDurpsgOYilkk6PXEVS1I6/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)
    - Top voted Tech Talk at Hack the North 2023

#### 2022
- [Hotspot and Binding Residue Prediction Using Embeddings](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YsG27N8W5kLrhAgaKt80BJ5kp1ccqVLBZNUr29kC9Ko/edit?usp=sharing)
    - Did undergrad research work in 2021-2022 on large transformers for protein sequences, focusing on applications to hotspot predictions. Showed results supporting the feasibility of using embeddings from large models (ESM-1b, ProtT5) for hotspot, binding and non-binding residue prediction. 



&nbsp;

### Miscellaneous 

These are some interesting things that I worked on: 

- [Orientalism in the Music of French Opera](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1crrPGjOr5IZAs2COe6bLNWP6SG26SzUG/view), A Technical Research Paper at the Intersection of Music and Continental Philosophy
    - Wrote my IB Extended Essay (capstone high school paper) on how music depicts social, cultural and philosophical "intangible" ideas with a technical analysis on 19th century French Opera.

- [Covid Army](https://github.com/covidarmy)
    - Led the backend team for a web app to search for medicines, ventillators and other supplies for Covid related emergencies for India. 240K+ users used the app.

- [Data Modelling for a Theory of Variable Physical Constants](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa2472)
    - Requested by auther to setup basic data modelling code to verify a theory of varying physical constants in the paper: “Cosmology with relativistically varying physical constants” by Rajendra P. Gupta, published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, staa2472, https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa2472, 25 August 2020.
    - This early work later led to results supporting a theory claiming the universe is twice as old as currently known: https://phys.org/news/2023-08-universe-theory-believed.html. 


- [Implemented and Trained StylePoseGAN  from scratch](https://wandb.ai/msinghal/spgan_spliced_runs?workspace=user-msinghal)
    - Implemented [StylePoseGAN](https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/Styleposegan/) paper on top of lucidrains' [stylegan2-pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/stylegan2-pytorch) and trained the GAN-based network from scratch. We were trying to build a product that enables users to pay and get new, AI-generated, realistic photos for their social media, Tinder, etc. in 2021 before StableDiffusion etc. we released.
    - Built web scrapers to get 800K+ training images from ecommerce sites paired on identity, and built the custom data processing pipeline to assemble curated train and custom eval sets. 

- [Scheme Interpreter in Haskell](https://github.com/ms337/scheme-in-haskell)
