# About
![Madhav](/assets/images/piano.jpg)

I am [Madhav](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava_(Vishnu)>).

I am currently an engineer on the AI team at [Replit](https://replit.com/~) where I train LLMs on code, and design and build our AI features and their underlying systems.

Born and raised in [one of the oldest cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allahabad) in India, I spent my formational years and found my footing at [Doon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doon_School), an all-boys boarding school at the foothills of the Himalayas. I am often asked about this unique experience, and I summarize it as: a mesocosm of "Lord of the Flies + Dead Poets Society + Hogwarts" with large doses of the real world. 

My formal education in university was in computer science, mathematics and philosophy. Affirming what my good friend Arth eloquently puts as, "our undergraduation was more of an immigration tax disguised as a degree",Â I gained most of my education outside the classrooms through textbooks, serendepitous discussions with peers and professors, internships, and most importantly, weaving through the intricate social fabric of a lively university that was once ranked No. 4 on Playboy's top 10 party schools. 

I continue to strive to be an autodidact in startups, evolutionary psychology, logic, computational biology, physics, and more. 

Having been training models since 2017, I have suddenly found myself in the midst of the AI boom. Despite the hype in the space, I believe that it is a paradigm shift in what technology means for humans, very much in the Kuhnian sense. I am currently directing my focus on deep learning, LLMs, and building real-world products leveraging them.

I currently live in Toronto, Canada but you can frequently find me in San Fransisco.
