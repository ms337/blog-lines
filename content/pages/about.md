# About
![Madhav](/assets/images/piano.jpg)

I am [Madhav](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava_(Vishnu)>).

I am currently working on AutoComputer. Before that I was on of the first engineers on the AI team at [Replit](https://replit.com/~) where I worked on pretraining and post-training LLMs for code, data infrastructure, built our core AI services for Replit AI, and worked on the Replit Agent. 

I was born and raised in [one of the oldest cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allahabad) in India. I spent my formational years and found my footing at [Doon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doon_School), an all-boys boarding school at the foothills of the Himalayas. 

My formal education in university was in computer science, mathematics and philosophy, but I try to learn as much as I can in my spare time about computational biology, evolutionary psychology, logic, physics, and more.

I have primarily worked in machine learning with a heavy emphasis on training deep learning models, data infrastructure, and backends +  distributed systems for ML and AI services. 

I recently moved to San Francisco full-time.
