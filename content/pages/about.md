# About
![Madhav](/assets/images/piano.jpg)

I am [Madhav](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava_(Vishnu)>).

I currently am an engineer on the AI team [Replit](https://replit.com/~), where I train LLMs and design and build our coding assistant agent and its infrastructure.

I formally studied computer science, mathematics and philosophy, but am interested in startups, evolutionary psychology, physics, computational biology, and much much more.

I was born and raised in [one of the oldest cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allahabad) in India. I spent my formational years in [Doon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doon_School), an all-boys boarding school at the foothills of the Himalayas.

I currently live in Toronto, Canada but you can frequently find me in San Fransisco for work.
