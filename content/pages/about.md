# About
![Madhav](/assets/images/piano.jpg)

I am [Madhav](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava_(Vishnu)>).

I am currently an engineer on the AI team at [Replit](https://replit.com/~) where I train LLMs on code, build data infrastructure and build services for our core AI features. 

Born and raised in [one of the oldest cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allahabad) in India, I spent my formational years and found my footing at [Doon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doon_School), an all-boys boarding school at the foothills of the Himalayas.

My formal education in university was in computer science, mathematics and philosophy, but I try to learn as much as I can about startups and building [magical products](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780195305678.001.0001/acref-9780195305678-e-70), computational biology, evolutionary psychology, logic, physics, and more.

I have primarily worked in machine learning with a heavy emphasis on training deep learning models, data infrastructure, and backends +  distributed systems for ML and AI services. 

I currently live in Toronto, Canada, but you can frequently find me in San Fransisco.
